# Simple-Psychological-Test-Website
> Two psychological test websites, which can get testers' inputs and store them on the server through CGI based on Apache. The websites have been mounted on a cloud server, but I cannot list the URLs because the website is being used. Maybe I can show their URLs here later.

The detailed instructions of the two tests are in the folders.
